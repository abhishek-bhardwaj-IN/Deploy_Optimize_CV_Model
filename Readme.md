## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Your Lab: Installation & Preparation üõ†Ô∏è

Let's get your environment ready for action!

1.  **Acquire the Codebase:**
    If this is a Git repository, clone it. Otherwise, ensure the file structure above is replicated.

2.  **Craft Your Python Sanctuary (Virtual Environment - Highly Recommended!):**
    Navigate to the project root (`Deploy_Optimize_CV_Model/`) in your terminal and execute:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    Activate this pristine environment:
    * **macOS/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`
    * **Windows:** `venv\Scripts\activate`

3.  **Install the Arsenal (Python Dependencies):**
    With your virtual environment active and humming:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    > **Note:** `requirements.txt` includes `ultralytics`. If your YOLOv12 variant hails from a different source (e.g., a specific GitHub repo), you'll need to follow its unique installation rites. Our scripts are tailored for an Ultralytics-esque YOLO API.
    > For NVIDIA GPU statistics in benchmarks, ensure `pynvml` is installed: `pip install pynvml`.

4.  **Curate Your Data (Mini COCO Dataset):**
    * Grab the COCO dataset (e.g., 2017 train/val images & annotations).
    * Sculpt your "mini" version by selecting a representative subset of images and their labels. This keeps training times sane!
    * Organize this treasure within `data/` as detailed in the "Project Blueprint."
    * Labels must be in **YOLO TXT format**: `<class_id> <center_x_norm> <center_y_norm> <width_norm> <height_norm>` (normalized coordinates).
    * Fashion your `data/data.yaml` file: it's the map for the training script, pointing to data paths and defining class names. Refer to the example provided.
    * Drop a few intriguing images into `data/test_images/` for swift inference checks.
    * **For Ultralytics INT8 PTQ (Post-Training Quantization):** Create a `data/calibration_data.yaml` file. This file should point to a small (e.g., 100-500 images) representative subset of your training images. Its structure is similar to `data.yaml`. Update the `CALIBRATION_DATA_YAML` path in `src/export_to_onnx.py` if you name it differently or place it elsewhere.

5.  **Leverage Giants (Optional: YOLOv12 Pretrained Weights):**
    For superior results and expedited fine-tuning, starting with pre-trained YOLOv12 weights (`.pt` files) is the way to go.
    * Download your chosen weights. The `train_yolo.py` (if using Ultralytics) might try to auto-download some models. If you have specific YOLOv12 weights, ensure `MODEL_VARIANT` in `train_yolo.py` knows where to find them.

## üöÄ Igniting the Engines: Running the Scripts üöÄ

With your virtual environment fired up, you're ready to launch the scripts. (Typically run from project root, or adjust paths accordingly).

1.  **Phase 1: Forge the Model (Training)**
    ```bash
    python src/train_yolo.py
    ```
    * Witness YOLOv12 learn from your `data/data.yaml`! The champion model (`best.pt`) will be enshrined in `trained_models/pytorch/`.
    * **Patience, Young Padawan:** Deep learning training demands computational might and time. A CUDA-enabled GPU is your best ally.
    * Keep an eye on `logs/training.log` and the console for dispatches from the training front.

2.  **Phase 2: The Great Translation (Export to ONNX - FP32, FP16, Attempt INT8)**
    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Crucial:** First, update `PYTORCH_MODEL_PATH` in `src/export_to_onnx.py` to the exact location of your `best.pt` from Phase 1. Ensure `CALIBRATION_DATA_YAML` is correctly set up if you want to attempt Ultralytics INT8 export.
    ```bash
    python src/export_to_onnx.py
    ```
    * This script will:
        * Export a standard FP32 ONNX model (`yolov12_coco.onnx`).
        * Attempt to export an FP16 ONNX model (`yolov12_coco_fp16.onnx`).
        * Attempt to export an INT8 ONNX model using Ultralytics' tools (`yolov12_coco_ultralytics_ptq.onnx`). This step might fail if your Ultralytics version doesn't support `int8=True` for ONNX, which will be logged.
    * Consult `logs/export.log` for the chronicle of these transformations.

3.  **Phase 3: Sharpen the Blade (ONNX Optimization)**
    ```bash
    python src/optimize_onnx.py
    ```
    * This script will:
        * Apply ONNX Runtime graph optimizations to the FP32 ONNX model (creating `yolov12_coco_optimized.onnx`).
        * If FP16 export was successful, graph-optimize the FP16 ONNX model (creating `yolov12_coco_fp16_optimized.onnx`).
        * If Ultralytics INT8 export was successful, graph-optimize that model (creating `yolov12_coco_ultralytics_ptq_optimized.onnx`).
        * **Fallback Quantization:** If Ultralytics INT8 export failed, this script will apply ONNX Runtime's dynamic quantization (typically to INT8 weights) to the graph-optimized FP32 model, creating `yolov12_coco_ort_quantized.onnx`.
    * Details in `logs/optimization.log`.

4.  **Phase 4: Desktop Duel (Single Image ONNX Inference with Overlay)**
    ```bash
    python src/test_onnx_model.py --model_path ../trained_models/onnx/YOUR_MODEL.onnx --image_path ../data/test_images/YOUR_IMAGE.jpg --output_image_path ../data/test_images/output_YOUR_MODEL.jpg
    ```
    * Substitute `YOUR_MODEL.onnx` (e.g., `yolov12_coco_fp16_optimized.onnx`) and `YOUR_IMAGE.jpg`.
    * An output image with detections will be saved.
    * The tale is told in `logs/test_onnx_model.log`.

5.  **Phase 5: The Gauntlet (Automated Benchmarking)**
    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Double-Check:** Ensure model paths defined at the top of `src/benchmark_suite.py` correspond to the files generated by the export and optimization scripts.
    ```bash
    python src/benchmark_suite.py
    ```
    * This is where models face their ultimate test! We benchmark:
        * Native PyTorch (CPU & GPU).
        * Various ONNX versions (FP32, Optimized FP32, FP16, Optimized FP16, Ultralytics INT8, Optimized Ultralytics INT8, ORT Quantized - depending on successful generation).
        * Metrics: Latency, throughput, model size, CPU/GPU memory, GPU utilization.
        * **PyTorch mAP50 (Train):** Calculated on the training set for PyTorch models.
    * **ONNX mAP50:** Remains a placeholder ("N/A") due to the complexity of a custom evaluation pipeline.
    * The grand results are displayed in a Markdown table and logged in `logs/benchmarking.log`.

6.  **Phase 6: Conquer the Web (Browser-Based Deployment)**
    * **Choose Your Champion:** Copy your preferred ONNX model (e.g., `yolov12_coco_fp16.onnx` or `yolov12_coco_ort_quantized.onnx`) to `src/web_deployment/` and name it `model.onnx` (or update `app.js` accordingly).
    * **Local Launchpad:** Serve the `web_deployment` directory:
        ```bash
        cd src/web_deployment
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
    * **Engage!** Point your browser to `http://localhost:8000`.
    * Select a backend, load the model, and upload an image.
    * ‚ÄºÔ∏è **Critical Web TODO:** The `preprocessImageForYOLO` and `postprocessYOLOOutput` functions in `app.js` **MUST** be accurately tailored to your specific YOLOv12 model's input needs and output structure (including Non-Max Suppression - NMS) for meaningful web detections.

## üîÆ Peering into the Matrix: ONNX Model Visualization üîÆ

One of ONNX's superpowers is transparency! Visualize your `.onnx` models with **Netron**:

1.  Visit [netron.app](https://netron.app/) or fire up the Netron desktop app.
2.  Open any `.onnx` file from `trained_models/onnx/`.
3.  Explore an interactive graph of your model. Click nodes (layers/ops) to inspect properties, inputs, and outputs. This is indispensable for:
    * Grasping the model's architecture.
    * Debugging PyTorch-to-ONNX conversion quirks.
    * Confirming optimizations (like node fusions) have taken effect.

## üìú The Scribe's Corner: Logging üìú

* We use Python's `logging` module for meticulous record-keeping.
* A master project log (`logs/main_project_{timestamp}.log`) captures the overarching narrative.
* Each key Python script pens its own detailed saga in the `logs/` directory (e.g., `training.log`).
* The console offers a running commentary of progress and key outcomes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats & Grand Quests (Important Notes & TODOs) ‚ö†Ô∏è

* **YOLOv12 Implementation Details:** Our scripts are harmonized with Ultralytics-style YOLO APIs. If your YOLOv12 is a different beast, you'll need to adapt model loading, training, and export calls.
* **Computational Resources:** Deep learning is demanding. A CUDA-enabled GPU is the mark of a serious practitioner.
* **Mini COCO Dataset Quality:** The quality and breadth of your dataset will shape your model's destiny.
* **Web Alchemist's Burden (`app.js`):** The JavaScript `preprocessImageForYOLO` and `postprocessYOLOOutput` functions are your sacred duty. They *must* be flawlessly implemented for your specific YOLOv12.
* **The True Measure (ONNX mAP):** `benchmark_suite.py` awaits your custom ONNX mAP calculation logic for a full accuracy comparison across all model types.
* **Error Handling:** While basic `try-except` blocks are in place, consider enhancing them for an even more resilient pipeline.
